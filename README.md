# RandomFairyChess
It's not as a regular Chess game, there some different with 3 Fairy Pieces (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_chess_piece) and with piece setup.

# This 3 Fairy pieces added
1. Empress
2. Princess
3. Grasshoper

# Piece setup variation
For both players every piece with setup randomly within their 2 rows. Among the 16 pieces of chess without KING will replace with one of 3 Fairy pieces Randomly.  

# Bugs
In this game, Checkmate has not implemented, only check will show for both Kings. Checkmate is not implemented due to time lacking.
